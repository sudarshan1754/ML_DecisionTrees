I have constructed the descision tree using training data and tested the data on it.

The programining language which I have used is Python.

You need to execute the final.py program as it contains the main method.

	***Execution step: python final.py <training_set> <test_set> <print_tree>


final.py : the execuation file
training_set : the data from which you build a decision tree
test_set : the test data which you run on the training_set              
print_tree : yes or no

I have included the outputs which I got in output folder

1. Information Gain heuristic
   output files for data_set1: train1_test1.txt  
   output files for data_set2:  train2_test2.txt

2. Variance Impurity Heuristic
   output files for data_set1: train_test_var.txt  
   output files for data_set2: train2_test2_var.txt

NOTE: 
To execute the Variance Impurity Heuristic pls remove the comment character '#'(#from var import *) from final.py and comment of "from Info import *"
